This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the

3. As a user, I want to see a user show page.
4. As a user, I want to create multiple to-do items.
5. As a developer, I want the development database to be automatically seeded with users and items.
6. As a user, I want to mark to-do items as complete and have them deleted.
7. As a user, I want to see how many days remain before a to-do item is automatically deleted.
8. To-do items should be automatically deleted seven days after their creation date.
